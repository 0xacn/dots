## Emoji Table

I use Emojis for all of my commits so I can easily identify and sort them. Below is the table explaining what each one means:

| Emoji | Description    |
| ----- | -------------- |
| 📄    | Documentation  |
| 🛠️    | Fix            |
| 🚀    | New Feature    |
| 🧪    | Testing        |
| 🙁    | Remove Feature |
| 🔴    | Remove a file  |
| 🟡    | Update a file  |
| 🟢    | Create a file  |
